       "  'text': 'Societal Influence  In the United States, many societal factors influence the number of  calories burned in a day. Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators  (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that  reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress  jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all  societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large  populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have  for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US  society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in  the weight management section of this chapter.  Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional  to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants  of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets  and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive  and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and  long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have  profound effects on the average body weight of Americans. The  number of homeless in this country is rising with many children and  adults living in hotels and cars. As you can imagine neither of these  “home spaces” has a kitchen, making it impossible to cook nutritious  meals and resulting in increased economically-forced access to  cheap, unhealthy foods, such as that at a nearby gas station.  Too Little or Too Much Weight: What Are the  Health Risks?  The number of people considered overweight and obese in the  world has now surpassed the number that are starving, with some  officials estimating that the number of overweight people is nearly  double the number of underweight people worldwide.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus.The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter.The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein.The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking.Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments.Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing.The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme.Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than  carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion.\"\n

    "            3. Vitamin E\n",
    "            Role: Antioxidant (protects cells from damage)\n",
    "            Sources: Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, green leafy vegetables\n",

      "- The Digestive System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your  mouth.When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat.Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food.Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body.To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules.The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells.The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract).\n",

      "- Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  From the Mouth to the Stomach  There are four steps in the digestion process (Figure 2.5 “The  Human Digestive System”).The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract.It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth.Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward.The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow.Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System.

      "- The Digestive System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your  mouth.When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat.Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food.Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body.To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules.The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells.The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract).\n",

      "- Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  From the Mouth to the Stomach  There are four steps in the digestion process (Figure 2.5 “The  Human Digestive System”).The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract.It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth.Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward.The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow.Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System.

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'The Digestive System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your  mouth.When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat.Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food.Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body.To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules.The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy\\xa0 or used as building blocks for new cells.The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract).',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  From the Mouth to the Stomach  There are four steps in the digestion process (Figure 2.5 “The  Human Digestive System”).The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract.It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth.Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward.The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow.Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System',\n",

      "      - Most mothers can make enough milk for their  babies whether they have small or large breasts.It is normal for a  woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size  or shape.During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in  size.If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during  pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or  a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to  ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy  into childhood.Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for  rapid growth and development.As a result, the WHO recommends  that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first  six months of an infant’s life.Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the  best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health  of her infant child.Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients  that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy  life.Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over  80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.\n",
      "- milk is the best source to fulfill nutritional requirements.An  exclusively breastfed infant does not even need extra water,  including in hot climates. A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to  twelve times a day or more.Between 1 and 3 months of age, the  breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of  feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of  milk consumed stays the same.After about six months, infants can  gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called  complementary foods.Complementary foods should be nutrient  dense to provide optimal nutrition.Complementary foods include  baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such  as yogurt, but not infant formula.Infant formula is a substitute, not  a complement to breastmilk.In addition to complementary foods,  the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding  continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy  of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or  longer.\n",
      "- child is 1 year old.7 See: https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/ 50-state-summary-breastfeeding-laws  Everyday Connection  In the Pacific, the state of Hawai‘i and and the territory of  Guam are mandated to provide several accommodations  within the workplace for new mothers. All employers are to  required to allow breastfeeding mothers adequate break  time to pump or nurse in location other than a bathroom.

Members of a community can also promote and support  breastfeeding.New mothers can join peer counseling groups or  turn to other women within their community who have previous  experience with breastfeeding.In addition, community-based  programs can provide education and support.The US Department  of Agriculture’s Women, Infants, and Children program provides  information on breastfeeding and both professional and peer  support for women and their babies from low-income families.

      "- is making sure that children receive an adequate amount of needed  nutrients to provide a strong foundation for the rest of their lives. Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed  their baby early in their pregnancy.Therefore, it is important to  offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first  prenatal appointment.  Support from family members, especially the  baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others  can greatly help with both the decision-making process during  pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding  after the baby’s birth.In the United States, about 83.2 percent of  babies start out being breastfed.1 Yet by the age of six months, when  solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along  with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United  States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2  The approval and assistance of family members, friends,  employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an  enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and  support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children. Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care  providers.During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has  given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the  benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique.Nearly  all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings,  and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and  discharge planning can inform and support women who want to  1. U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

      "- Breastfeeding.These steps include having a written policy  on breastfeeding communicated to health-care staff on a  routine basis, informing all new mothers about the benefits  and management of breastfeeding, showing new mothers  how to breastfeed their infants, and how to maintain  lactation, and giving newborns no food or drink other than  breast milk, unless medically indicated.Since the BFHI  began, more than fifteen thousand facilities in 134  countries, from Benin to Bangladesh, have been deemed  “baby friendly.”As a result, more mothers are breastfeeding  their newborns and infant health has improved, in both the  developed world and in developing nations.22 For  information on the Baby-Friendly Initiative in the US, see:  https://www.babyfriendlyusa.org. Barriers to Breastfeeding  Although breast milk is ideal for almost all infants, there are some  challenges that nursing mothers may face when starting and  continuing to breastfeed their infants.These obstacles include  painful engorgement or fullness in the breasts, often around day  3 to 5 postpartum, sore and tender nipples, lack of comfort or  confidence in public, and lack of accommodation to breastfeed or  express milk in the workplace. One of the first challenges nursing mothers face is learning how  22. UNICEF.The baby-friendly hospital initiative. http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/ baby.htm  832  |  Infancy.

There are other causative factors of GERD that may be separate  from or intertwined with obesity.The sphincter that separates the  stomach’s internal contents from the esophagus often does not  function properly and acidic gastric contents seep upward. Sometimes the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus are also  sluggish and compromise the clearance of acidic contents.In  addition to having an unbalanced, high-fat diet, some people with  GERD are sensitive to particular foods—chocolate, garlic, spicy  foods, fried foods, and tomato-based foods—which worsen  symptoms.Drinks containing alcohol or caffeine may also worsen  GERD symptoms.GERD is diagnosed most often by a history of the  frequency of recurring symptoms.A more proper diagnosis can be  made when a doctor inserts a small device into the lower esophagus  that measures the acidity of the contents during one’s daily  activities..

      "      - Digestion and Absorption of  Carbohydrates  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  From the Mouth to the Stomach  The mechanical and chemical digestion of carbohydrates begins  in the mouth.Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the  carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces.The salivary  glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles. Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase.This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches.The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose.The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness.Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.)When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach.\n",
      "- Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  From the Mouth to the Stomach  There are four steps in the digestion process (Figure 2.5 “The  Human Digestive System”).The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract.It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth.Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward.The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow.Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System\n",
      "- But mechanical  breakdown is ongoing—the strong peristaltic contractions of the  stomach mix the carbohydrates into the more uniform mixture of  chyme. Figure 4.6 Salivary Glands in the Mouth  240  |  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates\n",
      "- The Digestive System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your  mouth.When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat.Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food.Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body.To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules.The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells.The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract).\n",
      "- Salivary  glands  secrete  salivary  amylase,  which begins  the chemical  breakdown  of  carbohydrate s by breaking  the bonds  between  monomeric  sugar units. From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  The chyme is gradually expelled into the upper part of the small  intestine.Upon entry of the chyme into the small intestine, the  pancreas releases pancreatic juice through a duct.This pancreatic  juice contains the enzyme, pancreatic amylase, which starts again  the breakdown of dextrins into shorter and shorter carbohydrate  chains.Additionally, enzymes are secreted by the intestinal cells  that line the villi.These enzymes, known collectively as  disaccharidase, are sucrase, maltase, and lactase.Sucrase breaks  sucrose into glucose and fructose molecules.Maltase breaks the  bond between the two glucose units of maltose, and lactase breaks  the bond between galactose and glucose.Once carbohydrates are  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates  |  241.
